# Stock Trend Market Project

This project is a full-stack web application designed to track stock trends and visualize stock data over time. It includes a Vue.js frontend and an Express.js backend, with MongoDB as the database for storing stock information. Over the course of 6-8 months, the project builds key skills in full-stack development, API integration, data visualization, and more.

---

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Axios
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Other Tools**: Axios for API requests, `node-cron` for scheduling, and Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundations and Project Setup (Weeks 1-4)

#### Week 1: Initial Project Setup
- Set up a GitHub repository, project folder structure, and `.gitignore`.
- Initialize backend (`Express`) and frontend (`Vue`) projects.
- Research stock market APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) and obtain API keys.
- Configure environment variables for sensitive information.

#### Week 2: Setting Up the Backend
- Implement a basic Express server.
- Connect to MongoDB and create a stock data schema.
- Add routes (e.g., `/api/stocks`) to test MongoDB connectivity.

#### Week 3: Setting Up the Frontend with Vue
- Set up a basic Vue app.
- Install and set up Axios for HTTP requests.
- Test backend connection by fetching sample data from the backend.

#### Week 4: Finalizing Basic Connections
- Test and troubleshoot frontend-backend connection.
- Add error handling for requests.

---

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-12)

#### Weeks 5-6: CRUD Operations for Stock Data
- Add backend CRUD operations for stock data.
- Create API documentation.
- Develop frontend components for CRUD operations.

#### Weeks 7-8: Scheduled Data Fetching
- Use `node-cron` to periodically fetch stock data from the API and update MongoDB.

#### Weeks 9-10: Basic Data Visualization on Frontend
- Display stock data in a table format in Vue with sorting and filtering options.

#### Weeks 11-12: User Favorites and Preferences
- Allow users to mark stocks as favorites and filter their favorite stocks.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-24)

#### Weeks 13-16: Stock Trend Analysis
- Write backend functions for trend calculations.
- Create API routes and frontend components for trend data.

#### Weeks 17-20: Interactive Data Visualization
- Use Chart.js or D3.js for dynamic stock charts.
- Test and refine chart interactivity.

#### Weeks 21-24: User Authentication and Security
- Implement user registration and login with JWT.
- Restrict access to certain routes.

---

### Phase 4: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment (Weeks 25-32)

#### Weeks 25-28: Thorough Testing and Debugging
- Conduct end-to-end testing and write tests for all functionality.

#### Weeks 29-32: Deployment and Optimization
- Deploy backend on Heroku, frontend on Netlify/Vercel.
- Optimize project for production.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies for both frontend and backend.
2. Obtain stock API keys and add them to `.env` file.
3. Run the backend server and frontend client to start the application.
